+ **Project summary**: This project produced a shiny app which contains two parts: part1 - alternative fueling station locator and route planner, part2 - trend analysis of US alternative fuels stations and resources. In the first part, user can find nearby fueling stations or plan a route which would pass at least one fueling station. In the second part, we conducted statistical analysis towards the trend of US alternative fuels and fueling stations in the past 47 years. Research includes the environmental benefits of alternative fuels, the development trend of fueling stations and vehicles using such fuels.
